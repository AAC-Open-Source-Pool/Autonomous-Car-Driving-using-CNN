# Autonomous-Car-Driving-using-CNN

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>This project aims to develop a simulation environment for autonmous car driving using Convolutional Neural Network and Udacity Simulator. While Reinforcement Learning is the go-to functionality while dealing with decision making entities, we have chosen to go with Convolutional Neural Networks as they are light-in-weight when compared to Reinforcement Learning. Moreover, CNN provides better feature extraction</p>
